**Project Overview**

A simple calculator microservice built using Node.js and Express, providing four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Includes Winston logging for monitoring requests.


**Prerequisites**

Node.js (v18+ recommended)

Git

Visual Studio Code


**Installation and Setup**

git clone https://github.com/Dharani4432/sit737-2025-prac4p

npm install

npm install winston

node index.js


The server will start on http://localhost:3000.

**API Endpoints**

Addition: GET /add?num1=10&num2=5

Subtraction: GET /subtract?num1=10&num2=5

Multiplication: GET /multiply?num1=10&num2=5

Division: GET /divide?num1=10&num2=5


**Error Handling**

Invalid number inputs return a JSON error message.

Division by zero is handled gracefully.

**Logging with Winston**

Logs are stored in the logs/ directory:


error.log – stores error messages.

combined.log – stores all logs.
